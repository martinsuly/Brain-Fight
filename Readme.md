# Brain Fight

You surely remember on old school times when you fight with your classmates in math. This is something similar, you can
compete with your friends and see who is better. Brain Fight is a small multiplayer game where kids can learn math and improve
their logical thinking in a fun way.


## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

Counting and solving of logical tasks can be hard for most kids. Therefore we got an idea
to create a game within the topic "HTML5 games that are educational and learning oriented. (multiplayer preferred)"
where we use one of the common human nature - competitivity. Who would not be the first?
We all know the feeling of victory! Therefore we believe that children will be motivated to solve
logic tasks and count math to defeat their opponent.

Principle of the game is simple. At the begin a challenger must create the invitation URL and
then send it to his opponent. After this when both are connected and ready to start then the game begins.
The game consists from logical and mathematical tasks. The challenger and the opponent play on turns.
A player who is on the move must answer a logical task within the given time. If the player makes
a mistake or the time expires then the player lost and other one wins.
